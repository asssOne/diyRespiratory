What is diyRespiratory?
The idea is the creation of a respiratory open source, very low cost, with the aim of replacng medical respiratory when it is not available. I head from the news that now people are dying just because there is no more respirator/ventilator to help them breathing.

The idea is simple: putting together:
  - an air pump (made with 3D printer and RC motor+controller)
  - a pressure measurement system, very reliable (made with water in a transparent siphon)
  - safety over-pressure valves
  - controlled valve
  - an Arduino controller
  - tubes and other accessories
  
 Of course this device will NOT be medically certified, and must be used with much human care.
 
 The total cost is few dozen of euros, not more. It must stay extremely simple, easy to understand, easy to set-up, easy to use.
 
 Today, the Marck 16 2020 the idea is started, I will try to make prototype within few days.
